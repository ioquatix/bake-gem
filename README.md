# Bake::Gem

Provides bake tasks for common gem release workflows.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/ioquatix/bake-gem/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ioquatix/bake-gem/actions?workflow=Development)

## Installation

``` shell
$ bundle add bake-gem
```

## Usage

### Local

Releasing a gem locally is the most typical process.

``` shell
$ bake gem:release:version:(major|minor|patch) gem:release
```

This will bump the gem version, commit it, build and push the gem, then tag it.

### Automated

Releasing a gem via a automated pipeline is also supported. Locally, create a release branch:

``` shell
$ bake gem:release:branch:(major|minor|patch)
```

This will create a branch, bump the gem version and commit it. You are then responsible for merging this into master (e.g. using a pull request). Once this is done, to automatically release the gem:

``` shell
$ export RUBYGEMS_HOST=...
$ export GEM_HOST_API_KEY=...

$ bake gem:release
```
