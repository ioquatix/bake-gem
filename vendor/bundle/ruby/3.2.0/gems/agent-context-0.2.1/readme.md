# Agent::Context

Provides tools for installing and managing context files from Ruby gems for AI agents, and generating `agent.md` files following the <https://agent.md> specification.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/ioquatix/agent-context/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ioquatix/agent-context/actions?workflow=Test)

## Overview

This gem allows you to install and manage context files from other gems. Gems can provide context files in a `context/` directory in their root, which can contain documentation, configuration examples, migration guides, and other contextual information for AI agents.

When you install context from gems, they are placed in the `.context/` directory and an `agent.md` file is generated or updated to provide a comprehensive overview for AI agents.

## Quick Start

Add the gem to your project and install context from all available gems:

``` bash
$ bundle add agent-context
$ bake agent:context:install
```

This workflow:

  - Adds the `agent-context` gem to your project.
  - Installs context files from all gems into `.context/`.
  - Generates or updates `agent.md` with a comprehensive overview.
  - Follows the <https://agent.md> specification for agentic coding tools.

## Context

This gem provides its own context files in the `context/` directory, including:

  - `usage.md` - Comprehensive guide for using and providing context files.

When you install context from other gems, they will be placed in the `.context/` directory and referenced in `agent.md`.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://ioquatix.github.io/agent-context/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://ioquatix.github.io/agent-context/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use `agent-context`, a tool for discovering and installing contextual information from Ruby gems to help AI agents.

### Installation

Add the `agent-context` gem to your project:

``` bash
$ bundle add agent-context
```

### Commands

#### Install Context (Primary Command)

Install context from all available gems and update `agent.md`:

``` bash
$ bake agent:context:install
```

Install context from a specific gem:

``` bash
$ bake agent:context:install --gem async
```

#### List available context

List all gems that have context available:

``` bash
$ bake agent:context:list
```

List context files for a specific gem:

``` bash
$ bake agent:context:list --gem async
```

#### Show context content

Show the content of a specific context file:

``` bash
$ bake agent:context:show --gem async --file thread-safety
```

## Version Control

Both `.context/` and `agent.md` should be committed to git:

  - `agent.md` is user-facing documentation that should be versioned.
  - `.context/` files are referenced by `agent.md` and needed for AI agents to function properly.
  - This ensures AI agents in CI have access to the full context.

## Providing Context in Your Gem

To provide context files in your gem, create a `context/` directory in your gem's root:

    your-gem/
    ├── context/
    │   ├── getting-started.md
    │   ├── usage.md
    │   ├── configuration.md
    │   └── index.yaml (optional)
    ├── lib/
    └── your-gem.gemspec

### Optional: Custom Index File

You can provide a custom `index.yaml` file to control ordering and metadata:

``` yaml
description: "Your gem description from gemspec"
version: "1.0.0"
files:
  - path: getting-started.md
    title: "Getting Started"
    description: "Quick start guide"
  - path: usage.md
    title: "Usage Guide"
    description: "Detailed usage instructions"
```

If no `index.yaml` is provided, one will be generated automatically from your gemspec and markdown files.

## AI Tool Integration

The generated `agent.md` file can be integrated with various AI coding tools by creating symbolic links to their expected locations:

### Cline

``` bash
ln -s agent.md .clinerules
```

### Claude Code

``` bash
ln -s agent.md CLAUDE.md
```

### Cursor

First, create the `.cursor/rules` directory:

``` bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
```

Then create `.cursor/rules/agent.mdc` with:

``` markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
---
Read the `agent.md` file in the project root directory for detailed context relating to this project and external dependencies.
```

This approach uses Cursor's proper front-matter format and directs the AI to consult the main `agent.md` file.

### Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode

``` bash
ln -s agent.md AGENTS.md
```

### GitHub Copilot

``` bash
ln -s ../../agent.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

### Replit

``` bash
ln -s agent.md .replit.md
```

### Windsurf

``` bash
ln -s agent.md .windsurfrules
```
